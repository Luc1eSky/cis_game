# CIS Game

Welcome to the Mobile Agricultural Simulation Game (CIS Game) repository! This project was developed in collaboration with the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) as part of the "Accelerating Impacts of CGIAR Climate Research for Africa" (AICCRA) program, funded by the World Bank. The goal of this game is to provide a tool for better understanding how both male and female farmers in Zambia might incorporate Climate Information Services (CIS) into their agricultural decision-making processes.

# Overview
This repository contains the source code for a mobile agricultural simulation game designed specifically for use in Zambia. The game is intended to be a simple and user-friendly application that can be played offline by individual players or couples. It includes a practice mode for participants to familiarize themselves with the game mechanics before starting the actual simulation.

# Features
Offline Play: The game is designed to be playable without an internet connection, allowing participants in rural areas to engage with it easily.

Practice Mode: Participants can use the practice mode to understand the mechanics of the game before starting the actual simulation.

User-Friendly Interface: The interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, making it accessible to users with varying levels of technological proficiency.

Admin Page: Enumerators have access to an admin page where they can upload the data collected during the game to a database once an internet connection is reestablished.

#Getting Started
To get started with the game, follow these steps:

- Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone.
- Install Dependencies: Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed.
